Resonance is a central phenomenon in physics. In the context of electromagnetism, 
I study open resonators to predict their spectral properties through the computation 
of their quasi-normal modes associated with complex eigenfrequencies of Maxwell's 
operator.

      During my PhD, I developed a quasimodal expansion method (QMEM) to model and understand the scattering properties of
      arbitrary shaped two-dimensional open structures. In contrast with the bounded case which has only a discrete
      spectrum (real in the lossless media case), open resonators show a continuous spectrum composed of radiation
      modes and may also be characterized by resonances associated to complex eigenvalues (quasimodes). The use
      of a complex change of coordinates to build perfectly matched layers allows the numerical computation of those
      quasimodes and of approximate radiation modes. Unfortunately, the transformed operator at stake is no longer
      self-adjoint, and classical modal expansion fails. To cope with this issue, we consider an adjoint eigenvalue
      problem whose eigenvectors are biorthogonal to the eigenvectors of the initial problem. The scattered field is
      expanded on this complete set of modes leading to a reduced order model of the initial problem. The different
      contributions of the eigenmodes to the scattered field unambiguously appears through the modal coefficients,
      allowing us to analyze how a given mode is excited when changing incidence parameters. This gives physical
      insights to the spectral properties of different open structures such as nanoparticles and diffraction gratings.
      Moreover, the QMEM proves to be extremely efficient for the computation of local density of states.

      <p>
      I developped a model for the coupling of quasi-normal modes in
      open photonic systems consisting of two resonators. By expressing
      the modes of the coupled system as a linear combination of the modes
      of the individual particles, we obtain a generalized eigenvalue prob-
      lem involving small size dense matrices. We apply this technique to
      dielectric rod dimmer of rectangular cross section for Transverse 
      Electric (TE) polarization in a two-dimensional (2D) setup. The results of
      our model show excellent agreement with full-wave finite element sim-
      ulations. We provide a convergence analysis, and a simplified model
      with a few modes to study the influence of the relative position of the
      two resonators. This model provides interesting physical insights on
      the coupling scheme at stake in such systems and pave the way for
      systematic and efficient design and optimization of resonances in more
      complicated systems, for applications including sensing, antennae and
      spectral filtering.

          I designed an all-dielectric cloaking device at microwave frequencies. A gradient based topology optimization is employed to find a dielectric permittivity distribution that minimizes the diffracted field in free space. The layout is binary, i.e. made either of standard ABS plastic or air and is designed to reduce the scattering from an ABS cylinder excited by a line source for TE polarization. We study the performances of cloaks optimized for one, two and three frequencies in terms of scattering reduction and correlations with respect to the free space propagation case. Finally, a modal analysis is carried out providing physical insights on the resonant cloaking mechanism at stake.

I had the opportunity to give a talk about our latest work on quasi normal modes in elasticity at [Metamaterials 2024](https://congress.metamorphose-vi.org/). Great to be back to Chania in Crete after being there in 2016 for the 10th aniversary of the congress!

Here is the [abstract](/downloads/BVIAL_METAMATERIALS2024_pdfexpress.pdf) and the [slides](/downloads/BVIAL_metamaterials2024_no_anim.pdf).

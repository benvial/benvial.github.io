## Abstract

High-frequency homogenization is used to study dispersive media, containing inclusions placed periodically, for which the properties of the material depend on the frequency (Lorentz or Drude model with damping, for example). Effective properties are obtained near a given point of the dispersion diagram in frequency-wavenumber space. The asymptotic approximations of the dispersion diagrams and the wavefields so obtained are then cross-validated via detailed comparison with finite element method simulations in both one and two dimensions.
